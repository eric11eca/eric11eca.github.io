I am a senior undergraduate student studying computer science and mathematics at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu). I plan to attend graduate school after graduation and pursue a Ph.D. degree in the field of natural language understanding and reasoning. My main focus is on research. My research interests are **natural language processing and understanding**, particularly in building models capable of human-level inference and understanding of language. My research primarily focuses on **natural logic & monotonicity**, **neural language models**, **computational semantics**, and **natural language inference**. I'm currently working on probing implicit knowledge from language models for building better semantic representations from language, and on developing a novel learning framework that train models to learn human-level reasoning process through **meta reinforcement learning**.
