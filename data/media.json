    "date": "April 2025",
    "overview": "Researchers at EPFL's School of Computer and Communication Sciences and Yale School of Medicine have developed Meditron, an open-source large language model trained on carefully curated medical guidelines to improve access to evidence-based information for clinical decision-making. Meditron outperforms all other open-source models on a range of medical benchmarks and nears the performance of much larger closed models like GPT4. They are now evaluating its performance in the real world with a MOOVE [Massive Online Open Validation and Evaluation] led by volunteer doctors across various specialties.",
