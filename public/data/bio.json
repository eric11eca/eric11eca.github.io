    "bio": "I am a PhD student from the EPFL NLP Lab, supervised by Dr. Antoine Bosselut. I am a researcher for AI, Machine Learning, and NLP. I work on building AI reasoning agents with broad cognitive abilities. My research focus on developing strong foundation models, designing novel reasoning algorithms, and adapting them to human-centered applications in critical areas like medicine and global fairness. My research topics include: Reasoning as Test-time Learning, Large-scale AI Development (Foundation & Frontier models), World Model, and Agentic AI for Research & Science. My current work involves defining AI reasoning as test-time continual learning with new algorithms in RL post-training and Deep Research agents.",
